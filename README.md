## Goal 
Create a dynamic web page where an app that works inside a browser does not require to reload the page to see the results.

## What did I build?
I created a very simple and easy to use to do list where the user can add items as a reminder. The user can update and remove these items as they please as they progress. 

## How can this change?
You can change this to do list and convert it to a shopping list, a name list or really whatever you like! Simply clone this repository and head over to the code and change it to your liking.
